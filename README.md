# Radar_ML
A code project to develop a radar-based machine learning tool for severe thunderstorm wind prediction.

File list:
* implementation_phx.ipynb: This file contains the code to generate a database of thunderstorm objects paired with storm data reports. It specifically is designed for the Phoenix metro area. Only slight modifications (the removoal of one section) would allow this code to be utilized for any radar site.
